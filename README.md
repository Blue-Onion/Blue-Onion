# 👋 Hi, I’m Blue-Onion

Just your friendly neighbourhood developer.

I enjoy building things that are simple, fast, and slightly opinionated — from backend systems to full-stack apps.  
Currently spending most of my time with **Go**, **JavaScript/TypeScript**, and **databases**.

## 🛠 What I work with
- Go, Python
- JavaScript / TypeScript
- SQL & NoSQL databases
- React, Next.js
- Backend APIs & system design
- Docker, Linux


If something can be simpler, I’ll probably try to make it so.
